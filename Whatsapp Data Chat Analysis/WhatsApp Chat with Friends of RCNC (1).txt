10/18/23, 11:28 AM - Hellen Data: One thing that the Rotaract Club of Nairobi Central has consistently done,  is to bag awards. From the Country to the District level, we have been the home of awards; a true embodiment of how much we can achieve, when we come together.

The 2023 Annual Rotaract Kenya Country Dinner was no exception as the RCNC proudly scooped several awards in the Rotaract Kenya Gala Awards. We emerged the  Outstanding Club in "New Generation" and also in "Strategic Planning".

Further, we scooped individual awards with our President Fredrick Oburu being feted for being the "August President of the Month",  our Public Relations and Image Director Hellen Mwaura feted for her meticulous role in planning the Country Dinner and our Immediate Past President and Current Rotaract Kenya Deputy Country Chair Steve Maina awarded for a sustained mark of excellence!

This is RCNC where we are creating hope in the world in our own small ways. Join the bandwagon and amplify our impact because in the next gala awards, we shall be there no matter what 😊

Tukingojeanga Chelsea ipigwe hadi watuambie Salon yao iko wapi....😂😂😂

Here is a brief update for tomorrow's event. 

The Event is at St Catherine Pri Directly opposite Mater Hospital. From CBD Afya Center, Bus Station panda gari za South B, ni 30 Bob (unaeza lipa na bonga points btw).. sema wakuweke Mater Hospital. Its Exactly 7minutes, 23 seconds from town.

Or rather iyo 30 Bob buy mahindi ya 10bob, pita apo TUK vuka daraja, kuja straight hadi Mater Hospital. Iyo 20bob save utatoa happy dollar.

Alafu kindly let's try to be branded, vaa anything with our logo, ata za RYLA. Then tufike mapema kitu 7.30am ata tukiwa na Hangovers za leo usiku. Roles will be given kwa grao.

Then after event siunajua, tutaenda lunch alafu madrinks zishuke hadi magiz giz, hadi usiku, usiku, usiku wa mananeee😂😂

Ni hayo tu kwa sahii. Kwa wale wanapiga simu za wapoa sahii wanapata ziko off, usilose hope, ipo siku, atarudishwa tu Monday. Ako kwa auntie yake😂😂😂

Service Above Self 
Kupumzika ni Mbinguni
